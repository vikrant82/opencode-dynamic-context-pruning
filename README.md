Automatically reduces token usage in OpenCode by removing obsolete content from conversation history.

## Installation

Add to your OpenCode config:

```jsonc
// opencode.jsonc
{
    "plugin": ["@tarquinen/opencode-dcp@beta"],
}
```

Using `@beta` ensures you always get the newest version automatically when OpenCode starts.

Restart OpenCode. The plugin will automatically start optimizing your sessions.

## Beta Notice (v2.2.7-beta0)

- Strategy shift to a single user-facing context tool: `compress`.
- Context management is now less surgical and more focused on preserving high-signal work grouped by task.

## How Pruning Works

DCP uses one user-facing tool and strategies to reduce context size:

For model-facing behavior (prompts and tool calls), this capability is always addressed as `compress`.

### Tool

**Compress** — Exposes a `compress` tool that will select a conversation range and replace it with a technical summary.

The model can use `compress` at different scales: tiny ranges for noise cleanup, focused ranges for preserving key findings, and full chapters for completed work. The model will choose the best moment to compress based on session context size and opportunity.

### Strategies

**Deduplication** — Identifies repeated tool calls (e.g., reading the same file multiple times) and keeps only the most recent output. Runs automatically on every request with zero LLM cost.

**Supersede Writes** — Removes write tool calls for files that have subsequently been read. When a file is written and later read, the original write content becomes redundant since the current file state is captured in the read result. Runs automatically on every request with zero LLM cost.

**Purge Errors** — Prunes tool inputs for tools that returned errors after a configurable number of turns (default: 4). Error messages are preserved for context, but the potentially large input content is removed. Runs automatically on every request with zero LLM cost.

Your session history is never modified—DCP replaces pruned content with placeholders before sending requests to your LLM.

## Impact on Prompt Caching

LLM providers like Anthropic and OpenAI cache prompts based on exact prefix matching. When DCP prunes a tool output, it changes the message content, which invalidates cached prefixes from that point forward.

**Trade-off:** You lose some cache read benefits but gain larger token savings from reduced context size and performance improvements through reduced context poisoning. In most cases, the token savings outweigh the cache miss cost—especially in long sessions where context bloat becomes significant.

> **Note:** In testing, cache hit rates were approximately 85% with DCP enabled vs 90% without for most providers.

**Best use cases:**

- **Request-based billing** — Providers that count usage in requests, such as Github Copilot have no negative price impact.
- **Uniform token pricing** — Providers that bill cached tokens at the same rate as regular input tokens, such as Cerebras, see pure savings with no cache-miss penalty.

## Configuration

DCP uses its own config file:

- Global: `~/.config/opencode/dcp.jsonc` (or `dcp.json`), created automatically on first run
- Custom config directory: `$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR/dcp.jsonc` (or `dcp.json`), if `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` is set
- Project: `.opencode/dcp.jsonc` (or `dcp.json`) in your project's `.opencode` directory

### Commands

DCP provides a `/dcp` slash command:

- `/dcp` — Shows available DCP commands
- `/dcp context` — Shows a breakdown of your current session's token usage by category (system, user, assistant, tools, etc.) and how much has been saved through pruning.
- `/dcp stats` — Shows cumulative pruning statistics across all sessions.
- `/dcp sweep` — Prunes all tools since the last user message. Accepts an optional count: `/dcp sweep 10` prunes the last 10 tools. Respects `commands.protectedTools`.
- `/dcp manual [on|off]` — Toggle manual mode or set explicit state. When on, the AI will not autonomously use context management tools.

- `/dcp compress [focus]` — Trigger a single compress tool execution. Optional focus text directs what range to compress.
- `/dcp decompress <n>` — Restore a specific active compression by ID (for example `/dcp decompress 2`). Running without an argument shows available compression IDs, token sizes, and topics.
- `/dcp recompress <n>` — Re-apply a user-decompressed compression by ID (for example `/dcp recompress 2`). Running without an argument shows recompressible IDs, token sizes, and topics.

### Prompt Overrides

DCP exposes six editable prompts:

- `system`
- `compress`
- `context-limit-nudge`
- `user-turn-nudge`
- `assistant-turn-nudge`
- `iteration-nudge`

This feature is disabled by default. Set `experimental.customPrompts` to `true` in your DCP config to activate it.

When enabled, managed defaults are written to `~/.config/opencode/dcp-prompts/defaults/` as plain-text prompt files. A single `README.md` in that directory explains each prompt and how to create overrides.

To customize behavior, add a file with the same name under an overrides directory and edit it as plain text.

To reset an override, delete the matching file from your overrides directory.

> [!NOTE]
> `compress` prompt changes apply after plugin restart because tool descriptions are registered at startup.

### Protected Tools

By default, these tools are always protected from pruning:
`task`, `skill`, `todowrite`, `todoread`, `compress`, `batch`, `plan_enter`, `plan_exit`

The `protectedTools` arrays in `commands` and `strategies` add to this default list.

For the `compress` tool, `compress.protectedTools` ensures specific tool outputs are appended to the compressed summary. It defaults to an empty array `[]` but always inherently protects `task`, `skill`, `todowrite`, and `todoread`.

### Config Precedence

Settings are merged in order:
Defaults → Global (`~/.config/opencode/dcp.jsonc`) → Config Dir (`$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR/dcp.jsonc`) → Project (`.opencode/dcp.jsonc`).
Each level overrides the previous, so project settings take priority over config-dir and global, which take priority over defaults.

Restart OpenCode after making config changes.

## Limitations

**Subagents** — DCP is disabled for subagents by default. Subagents are not designed to be token efficient; what matters is that the final message returned to the main agent is a concise summary of findings. DCP's pruning could interfere with this summarization behavior.

You can opt in experimentally with `experimental.allowSubAgents: true`.
